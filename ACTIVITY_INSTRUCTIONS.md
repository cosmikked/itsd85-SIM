# LABORATORY ACTIVITY
## AI-Assisted Framework-Based REST API Development
### Backend Application Development for Information Technology

| System Case | Student Information Management REST API |
|---|---|
| **Development Mode** | Backend only - no graphical frontend is required |
| **Framework** | Student choice using any appropriate backend framework |
| **Primary Output** | Working, secured, documented REST API |
| **Database** | Relational database with migrations/schema and seed data |
| **Development Approach** | AI-assisted software development with human review and accountability |

The framework is a tool. The assessment focuses on API design, backend architecture, database quality, security, testing, documentation, and the student's ability to explain and modify the solution.

---

## 1. Laboratory Description

This laboratory activity requires students to design, develop, test, secure, and document a complete backend application using a RESTful API architecture. Students may choose the backend programming language, framework, ORM, database, and supporting tools that they consider appropriate for the problem, subject to the technical requirements stated in this activity.

The application will implement the backend of a Student Information Management System. It will expose structured HTTP endpoints for authentication, student records, academic programs, courses, academic terms, course offerings, enrollments, grades, and academic-record retrieval. A graphical frontend is intentionally excluded so that the laboratory concentrates on server-side engineering.

Artificial intelligence tools are encouraged as part of the development workflow. Students may use AI for planning, scaffolding, code generation, debugging, test generation, documentation, refactoring, and code review. However, every AI-generated artifact must be reviewed, tested, and understood before it is accepted into the project.

**Expected Result**

A reproducible REST API project that can be installed on another machine, connected to a database, tested through an API client, and explained during technical demonstration.

---

## 2. Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of the laboratory activity, students should be able to:

- Explain RESTful API principles and the relationship between HTTP methods, resources, status codes, and representations.
- Set up a backend project using a selected framework and relational database.
- Design normalized database tables, relationships, constraints, migrations, and seed data.
- Implement authentication and role-based authorization for protected resources.
- Develop CRUD endpoints and domain-specific endpoints using framework conventions.
- Validate incoming requests and return consistent success and error responses.
- Implement search, filtering, sorting, and pagination for collection endpoints.
- Apply backend security practices, including password hashing, secret management, and server-side authorization.
- Create and execute API tests using automated tests and an API client.
- Produce clear API and project documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger or an equivalent method.
- Use AI tools responsibly as development assistants while maintaining technical ownership of the submitted work.

---

## 3. AI-Assisted Development Policy

**AI Use is Encouraged**

Students are encouraged to use modern AI-assisted development tools. The goal is to practice contemporary software engineering in which AI accelerates work while the developer remains responsible for architecture, correctness, security, testing, and explanation.

### 3.1 Permitted Uses of AI

- Requirements analysis and decomposition
- Framework setup and configuration guidance
- Database and ERD design review
- Route, controller, service, repository, and model scaffolding
- Validation rules and error-handling patterns
- Debugging and root-cause analysis
- Test-case and test-data generation
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation assistance
- Security and code-review checklists
- Refactoring and performance suggestions
- README and technical documentation drafting

### 3.2 AI Accountability

The use of AI does not transfer responsibility for the final code. Students must verify all generated outputs and must be able to explain, debug, and modify the implementation during the laboratory demonstration.

- Do not submit code that you cannot explain.
- Do not accept AI-generated database or security code without reviewing it.
- Do not paste real passwords, private tokens, or confidential credentials into AI tools.
- Run tests after meaningful AI-generated changes.
- Prefer small, reviewable prompts and commits instead of asking an AI tool to generate the entire application at once.
- Record major AI contributions in the README or development notes when required by the instructor.

### 3.3 Recommended AI-Assisted Workflow

| Step | Developer Action |
|---|---|
| 1. Understand | Read the requirement and identify the business rule before prompting. |
| 2. Plan | Define the resource, data model, endpoint, validation, security, and tests. |
| 3. Prompt | Ask AI for a specific, bounded task using project context. |
| 4. Generate | Allow AI to propose code, tests, documentation, or fixes. |
| 5. Review | Read the generated output and compare it with framework conventions. |
| 6. Test | Run automated tests and API-client requests. |
| 7. Improve | Refactor, correct, secure, and optimize the implementation. |
| 8. Document | Update README, API docs, and development notes. |

---

## 4. Framework and Technology Freedom

Students may select any suitable backend framework. The selected framework does not determine the grade; the quality of the implementation does.

| Language | Examples of Appropriate Frameworks |
|---|---|
| PHP | Laravel, Symfony |
| JavaScript / TypeScript | Express.js, Fastify, NestJS |
| Python | Django REST Framework, FastAPI, Flask |
| Java | Spring Boot |
| C# | ASP.NET Core Web API |
| Go | Fiber, Gin, Echo |
| Ruby | Ruby on Rails |
| Kotlin | Ktor, Spring Boot |
| Other | Any appropriate framework approved by the instructor |

### 4.1 Database Choices

A relational database is required. Appropriate choices include PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, or SQLite for local development. Database access should use the framework's ORM/query layer or another safe parameterized method.

---

## 5. System Scenario

Develop a Student Information Management REST API that can be consumed by a future web, mobile, or desktop client. The API must centralize student and academic information and enforce access according to user roles.

### 5.1 Required User Roles

| Role | Minimum Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Administrator | Full system administration and access to all managed resources. |
| Registrar / Staff | Manage students, academic records, programs, courses, and enrollments as permitted. |
| Instructor | View assigned course offerings and manage grades for authorized enrollments. |
| Student | View only the student's own profile, enrollments, and grades. |

---

## 6. Required Domain Modules

| Module | Minimum Scope |
|---|---|
| Authentication | Login, logout/token invalidation where applicable, current authenticated user. |
| Users and Roles | User accounts, roles, status, authorization rules. |
| Students | Student profile, student number, program, year level, status, contact data. |
| Programs | Academic program code, name, description, status. |
| Courses | Course code, title, units, description, status. |
| Academic Terms | Academic year, semester/term, dates, status. |
| Course Offerings | Course, term, instructor, section, schedule, capacity, status. |
| Enrollments | Student registration in a course offering with status. |
| Grades | Grades linked to enrollment with remarks/status. |
| Academic Record | Aggregated student record grouped by academic term. |

---

## 7. Minimum Data Model

The following fields are minimum recommendations. Students may refine the schema where justified, but relationships, keys, and constraints must remain correct.

| Entity | Minimum Fields |
|---|---|
| users | id, name, email, password_hash, role/role_id, status, created_at, updated_at |
| students | id, student_number, first_name, middle_name, last_name, suffix, birth_date, email, contact_number, address, program_id, year_level, status, timestamps |
| programs | id, code, name, description, status, timestamps |
| courses | id, course_code, course_title, description, units, status, timestamps |
| academic_terms | id, academic_year, semester/term, start_date, end_date, status, timestamps |
| course_offerings | id, course_id, academic_term_id, instructor_id, section, schedule, room, capacity, status, timestamps |
| enrollments | id, student_id, course_offering_id, enrollment_date, status, timestamps |
| grades | id, enrollment_id, midterm_grade, final_grade/final_rating, remarks, timestamps |

### 7.1 Required Relationships

- One program has many students.
- One course may have many course offerings.
- One academic term may contain many course offerings.
- One instructor may handle many course offerings.
- One student may have many enrollments.
- One course offering may have many enrollments.
- An enrollment may have one grade record or an equivalent normalized grade structure.

### 7.2 Data Integrity Requirements

- student_number must be unique.
- course_code must be unique.
- Foreign keys must protect valid relationships.
- Duplicate enrollment in the same course offering must be prevented.
- Appropriate indexes should support frequently searched columns.
- Schema changes should use migrations or an equivalent reproducible mechanism.

---

## 8. REST API Design Standards

Use API versioning and resource-oriented URLs. A typical base path is `/api/v1`. Resource URLs should use nouns, while the HTTP method expresses the operation.

| Operation | Recommended Pattern |
|---|---|
| List students | GET /api/v1/students |
| Create student | POST /api/v1/students |
| Retrieve student | GET /api/v1/students/{id} |
| Replace/update student | PUT /api/v1/students/{id} |
| Partial update | PATCH /api/v1/students/{id} |
| Delete/deactivate | DELETE /api/v1/students/{id} |

**Avoid RPC-style resource names**

Prefer `GET /students` and `POST /students`. Avoid endpoints such as `/getStudents`, `/createStudent`, or `/deleteStudent` unless the operation is truly an action that cannot be expressed as a resource.

### 8.1 Required Endpoint Groups

**Authentication**
- POST /api/v1/auth/login
- POST /api/v1/auth/logout or equivalent token invalidation
- GET /api/v1/auth/me

**Students**
- GET /api/v1/students
- POST /api/v1/students
- GET /api/v1/students/{id}
- PUT or PATCH /api/v1/students/{id}
- DELETE /api/v1/students/{id}

**Programs**
- GET/POST /api/v1/programs
- GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/programs/{id}

**Courses**
- GET/POST /api/v1/courses
- GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/courses/{id}

**Academic Terms**
- GET/POST /api/v1/academic-terms
- GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/academic-terms/{id}

**Course Offerings**
- GET/POST /api/v1/course-offerings
- GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/course-offerings/{id}

**Enrollments**
- GET/POST /api/v1/enrollments
- GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/enrollments/{id}
- GET /api/v1/students/{id}/enrollments
- GET /api/v1/course-offerings/{id}/students

**Grades**
- GET/POST /api/v1/grades
- GET/PUT/PATCH /api/v1/grades/{id}
- GET /api/v1/students/{id}/grades

**Academic Record**
- GET /api/v1/students/{id}/academic-record

### 8.2 HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Expected Use |
|---|---|
| 200 OK | Successful retrieval or update with response content. |
| 201 Created | A resource was successfully created. |
| 204 No Content | Successful operation without response body when appropriate. |
| 400 Bad Request | Malformed or invalid request outside normal validation semantics. |
| 401 Unauthorized | Authentication is missing or invalid. |
| 403 Forbidden | Authenticated user lacks required permission. |
| 404 Not Found | Requested resource does not exist. |
| 409 Conflict | Duplicate/conflicting state where appropriate. |
| 422 Unprocessable Content | Request validation failed. |
| 500 Internal Server Error | Unexpected server failure; details must not leak sensitive internals. |

---

## 9. Response and Error Consistency

Establish a consistent JSON response format. Framework conventions may be used, but the API must be predictable and documented.

**Example Success Response**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Student retrieved successfully.",
  "data": { "id": 1, "student_number": "2026-00001" }
}
```

**Example Validation Error**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation failed.",
  "errors": { "email": ["A valid email address is required."] }
}
```

---

## 10. Validation Requirements

- student_number: required and unique.
- first_name and last_name: required.
- email: valid email format when supplied.
- program_id: must reference an existing program.
- course_id, academic_term_id, instructor_id, student_id, and course_offering_id: must reference valid records.
- year level and status values: restricted to documented valid values.
- grade values: must follow the grading range/rules defined by the implementation.

Validation must occur on the server. Invalid input must not be persisted simply because a client sends it.

---

## 11. Search, Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination

| Feature | Example |
|---|---|
| Search | GET /api/v1/students?search=dela |
| Filter | GET /api/v1/students?program_id=1&year_level=3&status=ACTIVE |
| Sort | GET /api/v1/students?sort=last_name or another documented convention |
| Pagination | GET /api/v1/students?page=2&per_page=20 |

Collection endpoints must not return unbounded datasets. Pagination metadata should include enough information for a client to navigate results, such as current page, page size, total records, and last page or equivalent cursor information.

---

## 12. Authentication and Authorization

The API must implement secure authentication and server-side authorization. Authentication answers who the user is; authorization determines what that user is allowed to do.

### 12.1 Authentication

- Passwords must be hashed using an appropriate framework-supported password-hashing mechanism.
- Protected routes must require a valid authenticated session or token.
- The API must provide a current-user endpoint or equivalent mechanism.
- Logout or token invalidation should be implemented where supported by the authentication strategy.

### 12.2 Authorization

| Role | Minimum Access Rule |
|---|---|
| Administrator | May manage all required resources. |
| Registrar / Staff | May manage student and academic records according to configured permissions. |
| Instructor | May view assigned offerings and modify grades only for authorized enrollments. |
| Student | May view only the student's own profile, enrollment, and grade information. |

**Object-Level Authorization**

A student must not be able to retrieve another student's confidential academic record merely by changing an ID in the URL. Authorization must be enforced on the server for the actual requested resource.

---

## 13. Backend Security Requirements

- Use environment variables or a secure configuration mechanism for secrets.
- Do not commit the real .env file, database password, private keys, or tokens to a public repository.
- Use parameterized queries, ORM/query-builder safeguards, and proper validation to prevent SQL injection.
- Do not expose raw database exceptions, stack traces, or sensitive implementation details in normal production responses.
- Do not return password hashes, authentication secrets, or unnecessary sensitive fields in API responses.
- Apply authorization to every protected action, not only to menu or client-side behavior.
- Configure CORS deliberately when browser clients are expected; do not use unrestricted production settings without justification.
- Log useful operational errors without logging passwords or private tokens.

---

## 14. Environment and Reproducibility

The project must be reproducible on another machine. Include a safe .env.example or equivalent configuration template, migration/schema files, seeders/fixtures, dependency manifests, and installation instructions.

**Example Configuration Variables**

```
APP_ENV=development
APP_PORT=8000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=student_api
DB_USER=app_user
DB_PASSWORD=...
AUTH_SECRET=...
```

---

## 15. Required Test Data

| Entity | Minimum Demonstration Records |
|---|---|
| Users | 5 |
| Programs | 3 |
| Students | 100 |
| Courses | 20 |
| Academic Terms | 2 |
| Course Offerings | 20 |
| Enrollments | 200 |
| Grades | 100 |

Use seeders, factories, fixtures, scripts, or equivalent tools. Manually inserting every demonstration record is discouraged.

---

## 16. Testing Requirements

Testing must include successful and unsuccessful requests. Automated tests are strongly encouraged and should cover the most important security and business flows.

| Area | Minimum Test Cases |
|---|---|
| Authentication | Valid login; invalid password; missing/invalid authentication. |
| Students | Create; retrieve; update; duplicate student number; invalid email; not found. |
| Authorization | Permitted administrator action; forbidden student/instructor actions; object-level access control. |
| Enrollment | Valid enrollment; invalid references; duplicate enrollment prevention. |
| Grades | Valid grade; invalid enrollment; unauthorized grade modification. |
| Collections | Search; filtering; sorting; pagination behavior. |

### 16.1 Recommended Automated Test Tools

Use the test framework appropriate to the chosen technology, such as Pest/PHPUnit, Vitest/Jest, Pytest, JUnit, xUnit, or Go testing. At minimum, automated tests should exercise authentication, student creation, validation, authorization, enrollment, and grade submission.

---

## 17. API Documentation

Complete API documentation is mandatory. Swagger UI/OpenAPI is preferred, but equivalent documentation may be accepted when it clearly describes the contract.

- Endpoint path and HTTP method
- Description and purpose
- Authentication requirement
- Path/query parameters
- Request body schema and example
- Successful response schema and example
- Validation/error response examples
- Relevant HTTP status codes

A documented route such as `/api/docs` is recommended where the framework supports it.

---

## 18. API Client Collection

Prepare a Postman, Insomnia, Bruno, or equivalent API collection that demonstrates the major endpoints and includes both successful and failed requests. Organize requests by resource group: Authentication, Students, Programs, Courses, Academic Terms, Course Offerings, Enrollments, Grades, and Academic Records.

---

## 19. Laboratory Development Phases

## 25. Critical Deficiencies

**Significant Deductions**

A submission may receive major deductions if it has no working REST API, no real database integration, no authentication, plaintext passwords, missing server-side authorization, static/hardcoded API data, no validation, no API demonstration, or if the student cannot explain major source code and AI-generated portions.

---

## 26. Optional Enhancements

- Refresh-token strategy or secure session rotation
- Email verification and password reset
- Rate limiting
- Soft delete and recovery
- Audit trail/activity logs
- Dockerized development environment
- CI/CD pipeline
- Redis caching
- CSV import/export
- PDF academic record generation
- Health/readiness endpoints

- Integration tests and performance tests

Bonus features do not replace incomplete core requirements.

---

## 27. Final Development Principle

**AI Accelerates Development; the Developer Owns the Result**

Use AI to reduce repetitive work, explore alternatives, debug faster, and improve documentation. Do not use AI as a substitute for understanding. Every endpoint, schema decision, security rule, and test result remains the responsibility of the developer.
